#summary Our ideas about implementing data domains
#labels Phase-Requirements

The Architect currently does not support the concept of data domains, but it's a feature we have been planning to add for some time.

Features we'd like to include include:

 * User-defined domains with customized names
 * Mappings to JDBC types, including precision and scale (for forward engineering)
   * ability to generate DDL with user-defined types in databases that support it
 * Ability to define a hierarchy of domain types (such as a Monetary base class which would then have CAD, USD, and so on)
   * This would be handy when making summary tables for OLAP tools, since general types could have good predefined formatting rules: Discrete Count, Continuous Value, Monetary, Percentage, and so on.
 * Introduce named enumerated types that forward engineer as ENUM or check constraints depending on target platform support and idioms
 * You would see Domain names wherever data types are currently used
   * Have a project setting to choose between displaying JDBC types and Domains (in edit panels as well as table panes and so on)
 * User-defined domains would be saved with each project
   * Should be able to "extract" the domains from a project file so that they can be used in the current project
