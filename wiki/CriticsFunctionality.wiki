#summary A High-level description of the planned Critics functionality.

= Introduction =

The idea behind the Critics feature is to have a monitor of your data model that will notify the user of errors, mistakes, and bad practices in their data model. A simple analogy would be like how spell-checking works in modern word processors.


= High Level Description =

== Requirements for the next release (0.9.15) ==

  * Support for platform-specific rules 
    * ex. Oracle table names cannot be longer than 30 characters

  * Support for detecting bad database design practices
    * ex. Tables without primary keys

  * Visual notification to the user of problems
    * Provide a visual list of items that critics have found
    * Highlighting of items in the playpen

  * Allow the user to disable and enable critics
    * If you're only working with Oracle, then you probably don't care about critics for SQL Server, MySQL, etc

  * Real-time monitoring of your data model?
    * Critics would be monitoring your data model as you edit it.
    * Would require some technical research into multi-threaded access of the SQL Objects
    * Optionally, to limit the scope, critics could be run on demand instead

== Items to consider for later? ==
  * User-defined critics
