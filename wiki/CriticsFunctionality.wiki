#summary A High-level description of the planned Critics functionality.

= Introduction =

The idea behind the Critics feature is to have a real-time monitor of your data model that will notify the user of errors, mistakes, and bad practices in their data model. A simple analogy would be like how spell-checking works in modern word processors.


= High Level Description of Requirements for the next release (0.9.15) =

  * Support for platform-specific rules 
    * ex. Oracle table names cannot be longer than 30 characters
  * Support for detecting bad database design practices
    * ex. Tables without primary keys
  * Visual notification to the user of problems
    * Provide a visual list of items that critics have found
    * Highlighting of items in the playpen
  * Allow the user to disable and enable critics
    * If you're only working with Oracle, then you probably don't care about critics for SQL Server, MySQL, etc
    * 

 = Items to consider for later? =
  * User-defined critics
